Here is a list of projects that other people have done, that use my library:

* fimap  --  http://code.google.com/p/fimap/

  fimap is a little python tool which can find, prepare, audit, exploit and
  even google automaticly for local and remote file inclusion bugs in webapps.

* translate.org.za  --  http://www.translate.org.za/
  
  Translate.org.za is focused on the localisation, or translation, of Open
  Source software into South Africa's 11 official languages and localisations
  of GNOME, KDE, OpenOffice.org, Firefox and Thunderbird.
